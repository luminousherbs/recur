    <p>I asked five language models to redesign the CSS for this website. Here are the results.</p>
    <select id="dropdown">
        <option value="ai/default">Default</option>
        <option value="ai/chatgpt">GPT 4.1</option>
        <option value="ai/gemini">Gemini 2.0 Flash</option>
        <option value="ai/llama">Llama 3.3 70B</option>
        <option value="ai/claude">Claude 3.5 Sonnet</option>
        <option value="ai/mistral">Mistral</option>     
    </select>

    <p>I thought this would be an interesting challenge because the AIs wouldn't be able to see how their code actually displayed. Programming benchmarks tend to focus on technical languages like JavaScript and Python, so I wanted to see how they would perform when tasked with something unfamiliar.</p>

    <p>Every model was given my <a href="/recur/assets/styles/ai/default.css">original CSS</a> for reference, with the prompt "redesign my CSS to look nicer". One drawback of this approach was that the models all made minor tweaks, relying heavily on the code I provided. Most models also tried to restructure my code to be more readable (particularly Mistral, which I personally think went a bit overboard). All the results include light and dark themes, which you can toggle between by changing your browser's theme.</p>

    <p>ChatGPT made the most changes - it added fancy button animations and alternating shading in tables. It was also the most imbalanced result, with a strong light theme but a disgusting mess of gradients and shadows in the dark theme.</p>

    <p>I think Gemini's is my favorite. The color choices were a bit weird, but everything else is very clean and well thought out. I especially like how the buttons look - I might actually prefer them to my original ones.</p>

    <p>Mistral defined lots of colors for categories like info, success and danger but confusingly never used them. This could be because it ran out of characters - most web interfaces cap the model's output at around 4000. If you're interested, the colors look like this:
        <button style="background-color: var(--color-primary); border: none;">primary (#3498db)</button>
        <button style="background-color: var(--color-secondary); border: none;">secondary (#2ecc71)</button>
        <button style="background-color: var(--color-danger); border: none;">danger (#e74c3c)</button>
        <button style="background-color: var(--color-warning); border: none;">warning (#f39c12)</button>
        <button style="background-color: var(--color-info); border: none;">info (#1abc9c)</button>
        <button style="background-color: var(--color-success); border: none;">success (#2ecc71)</button>
    . The only color it actually uses is <code>warning</code>, except it chose to use it as the default button color. Weird.
    </p>

    <p>Llama's CSS is very similar to Gemini's, with some small issues. I think its square corners look worse than Gemini's rounded ones, especially on the buttons. I also don't like that it gave textarea a sans-serif font - in my opinion it should always be monospaced.</p>

    <p>Claude made the fewest changes, leaving my orginal code mostly unchanged. I really like the way it styled the textarea, and I might use it in my CSS in the future. My only complaint is that disabled buttons still light up when hovered.</p>

    <p>Every single model chose to leave no margin between the text and the edge of the  I have no idea why, since almost all websites include a margin. My only guess is that the absence of an explicitly defined margin in my original CSS caused the AIs to forget they needed to define one.</p>

        <p>i cant be bothered to write anything else so thats all. have a look at the example elements below if you want.</p>
